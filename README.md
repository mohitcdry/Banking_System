<h1>PLEASE DO NOT COPY THE CODE AND USE IT FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSE</h1>
<p>That is all, This is one of my first actual beginner's project in Python and there are bound to be many problems found within it and it could also be written more efficiently, So, I am always ready to hear your suggestion.</p>

<h1>THANK YOU</h2>
